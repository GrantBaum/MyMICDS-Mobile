# API Endpoints for MyMICDS.net
For pretty much anything interacting with the API, you'll send a HTTP POST request to the server. Here is a list of all the endpoints and what data you will receive. Different parts of the API are grouped with different files for organization.

Most of the API's return an `error` entry in the JSON. Most of the time, the error will be null. If an error does happen to occur, it will return a string, and the other inputs will be null.

Modules or 'libraries' are were the functionality and core of the of the website is at. Each module should be relatively short and do one job and do it well. **By themselves, modules do nothing. Modules are where the functionality is.**

Endpoints or 'routes' and different URL's that you can send information to. This usually plugs directly into the modules, or serves webpages to be viewed by the user. **Routes control the URLs and the information that passes through them. Routes are the bridge between the users and the functionality.**
